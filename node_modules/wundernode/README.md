wundernode
-------
NodeJS API to integrate with [Wunderground API](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/).

This library provides NodeJS with an abstraction to the [Wunderground API](http://http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) allowing developers to query and integrate Wunderground services into their own applications.

This library nor the authors have any formal relationship with Wunderground other than the  wind we use.

## Getting Started

 1. If you have never done so, sign up for [Wunderground] Dev API service(http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) 
 2. Wait for you API key to be generated. This should be quick
 3. Download wundernode: `npm install wundernode`
 4. Look at the Example. Replace the null apikey value with your api key.
 5. Play with the example. Good stuff, praise node some and the wunderground developers for opening a nice JSON API.
